# Assumptions of ch2 test

# Assumption 1: Both variables are categorical.
# Gender: This variable can only take on two categories – Male or Female.
# Political Party Preference: This variable can take on three categories – Republican, Democrat, or Independent.


# Assumption 2: All observations are independent. (two people should not from same family)
# It’s assumed that every observation in the dataset is independent. 
# That is, the value of one observation in the dataset does not affect the value of any other observation.
# The only way to check this assumption is to verify that each individual included in this dataset was surveyed independently of every other individual.
# If we used a random sampling method (like simple random sampling) then this assumption is likely met.


# Assumption 3: Cells in the contingency table are mutually exclusive.
# We can verify that this assumption is met by checking that no individual has been counted in more than one cell. 
# Assuming each individual in the dataset was only surveyed once, this assumption should be met 
# because it’s not possible for an individual to be, say, a Male Republican and a Female Democrat simultaneously.

# Assumption 4: Expected value of cells should be 5 or greater in at least 80% of cells.
# It’s assumed that the expected value of cells in the contingency table should be 5 or greater in at least 80% of cells and 
# that no cell should have an expected value less than 1.


# Expected value = (row sum * column sum) / table sum.
# For example, the expected value for Male Republicans is: (230*250) / 500 = 115.
